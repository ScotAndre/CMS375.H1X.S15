 *
 *  Assignment instructions:
 *  Write a Java application that uses JDBC to display sections and semester
 *  for a course.
 *  First your program should prompt the user for the user name and password.
 *  Then your program should read the course names from the database, display
 *  all the course names, and prompt the user for which course they want the
 *  information.
 *
 *  You can build a GUI for this program if you want. In that case, the user
 *  would select the course name from a JComboBox.
 *
 *  Example output if the user chooses "Intro to C++":
 *
 *     Course Name             Section       Semester
 *     Intro to C++                  2       Fall
 *                                   1       Fall
 *
 *  Note that the course name is outputed only once, even if the course has
 *  multiple sections.
 *
 *  Deliverables:
 *    Your Java source code (zipped) and a report that answers these questions:
 *
 *    1. Explain the roles that each of these components play in JDBC:
 *       a. JDBC Driver
 *       b. Connection
 *       c. Session
 *       d. Statement
 *       e. ResultSet
 *       f. ResultSet MetaData
 *
 *    2. When should you use the 'executeUpdate' method versus the
 *       'executeQuery' method? In other words, what is the difference between
 *       these two statements?
